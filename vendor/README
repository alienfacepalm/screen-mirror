When you clone minicap it will come with a run.sh file. 

Replace that file with run_minicap.sh here. 

The original file has some lines that detect resolution that no longer work.
This new file fixes that problem. 

HOW TO INSTALL new run.sh 

cd vendor
git clone https://github.com/openstf/minicap.git
mv ./run_minicap_fix.sh ./mincap/run.sh

./minicap/run.sh autosize
