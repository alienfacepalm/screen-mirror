The setup.sh script will fetch your vendor deps and fix the run.sh in
minicap. 

You still need to run ndk-build in each minicap and minitouch root
directories. You must have NDK and ndk-build in  your $PATH env var. 
Then enter minicap and minitouch directories and simply run `ndk-build`. 

Run

./setup.sh
